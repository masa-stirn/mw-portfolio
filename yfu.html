            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <h3> Social media video marketing campaign. The goal is to reach Danish high school and college students. </h3>
            <p>The purpose of the multimedia campaign is to ensure brand recognition, reach
and sell to the appointed target audience. In order to build a strong campaign
that reaches the users, we performed external and internal analysis of the
company and the current market. We strongly focused on target group analysis,
conducted SWOT and TOWS analysis that leads us to outline the final
communication plan.</p>
            <p>The goal of the campaign is to encourage users to participate in the video
contest and spread the word about YFU international study exchange programs.
We want to inform the target audience not only about the contest and exchange
programs but also about the strong volunteering community at YFU.
The promotional video will encourage the user to apply for the social media
contest and later follow the ambassadors’ stories. Those activities will motivate,
engage and guide users to apply for the exchange program.

            <h1>Personas</h1>
            <h3> Personas were inspired by students from Roskilde gymnasium. We focused on reaching Danish audience.</h3>
            <p>In order to create good research-driven personas, we went on a field trip to Roskilde.
            </p><p>
We performed interviews and organized a focus group session. To further elaborate and
generalize personas we supported the study with online research based on the general
statistics. Furthermore to help us understand Danish youth we created a questionnaire
and share with the Danish students living in the dorms in Copenhagen. Combaining
all the results we created the following two fiction personas.

            <h1>Why Video?</h1>
            <h3>Nowadays images and videos are the most shared content on the social networks.</h3>
            <p>The promotional video will present and promote the contest to students who wish to win the scholarship
with YFU.
</p>
            <p>Main purpose is to attract the target audience who will participate and raise YFU
brand awareness. The video will clearly demonstrate the steps on how to
participate in the campaign, emphasise the rewards as well as communicate the
participation requirements. It will be published on the YFU contest webpage,
Facebook and Instagram.
            </p>
            <p>Nowadays images and videos are the most shared content on the social networks.
Often the more spontaneous and less-professional videos achieve a much greater
level of virality. The less professional videos will give a greater impression
of truth and reality. Another benefit of video is it gives creators a wider range of
creativity by combining texts, images, and sound. On the other hand, videos are
perceived as convenient and allow users to watch the content instead of reading
texts. Video content has been proven to significantly increase engagement,
conversion, and reach. Moreover, research has shown that users are 80% more
likely to follow a video link over a link to any other type of content.
