            <h1>Problem / Solution</h1>
            <h3>One app that connects security office management with security guards.</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Problem</p>
            <p>
The security office needs to digitize their process of managing the employees' schedules. Until now they used excel spreadsheets to plan security guards' daily schedules. They then provided the schedules in person to each employee. This process allowed them very little room for dynamic rescheduling and updates. Moreover, they would also like to know the whereabouts of their employees and get an instant confirmation of their completed tasks and patrols.
</p>
           <p>Solution</p>
            <p>
For the security office management we designed a desktop supervising tool where they can plan and manage security guards' schedules. The desktop app is interconnected to the patrol station mobile app where each employee has access to their schedule. It can receive live updates to their work schedules. The progress of each task is automatically linked back to the desktop application which gives stakeholders an opportunity to track employees progress and whereabouts.

            <h1>Brainstorming</h1>
            <h3>First 2 days of work were focused on group brainstorm sessions</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
Brainstorming on the whiteboard, with the company owner Andrej and my manager Filip, was the key step in the process of generating ideas and discussing the market needs. In order to get a better idea of what the app should deliver we sketched various product ideas and we wrote down features we believed the app should deliver. Also we browsed through similar apps and designs and performed competitor analyses. Once we had the general idea laid out, I moved on to learning more about the target users.

            </div>
            <p>The main persona that will use the desktop app is the patrol planner persona. This persona works at the security office and uses both desktop and mobile app. She uses the desktop app to plan the security guards' schedules and keeps track of employees work progress and task completion.
            </p><p>
The second persona that will use desktop app is the upper management persona. This persona is one of the stakeholders of the business and fills the top positions in the company. This persona needs to have a quick and easy overview of completed tasks and patrols so they can provide proof of top performance and completion of the security services to potential business clients.

            <p>As the only designer in the company I tackled the next step on my own. I first reviewed the ideas we generated at the brainstorm sessions and then proceeded to bringing our concepts and ideas to life in the form of lo-fidelity drafts and sketches. </p>

            <p> The next day, I presented the sketches to my project manager Filip. Because the sketches were drawn with a pencil, it was relatively easy to quickly implement changes and add additional corrections and further improvements.

            </div>
            <p>To ensure brand recognition, I decided to keep consistent use of colors and typography throughout the mobile and desktop app. Slight modifications were applied to the selection of the highlighting colors, as well as minimal font adaptations, to ensure better readability and legibility on different screen sizes.
            </p>
            <p>I kept the Icons consistent with the icons we were using in the mobile app. Similar to the mobile app, I created SVG icons and generated icon font through Icomoon online platform. The font consisted of all the icons that are easily added to the code and are flexible to be styled in color and size by using code.

High fidelity prototypes were redesigned based on the feedback received from everyone involved in the project. We Included feedback from a variety of sources. This included other team members from business and coding department; as well as from target users of the app.

            <p>Example of a feature added based on the user feedback. We implemented simple fold in the left sidebar menu that gives the user an option to see the larger scheduling interface.

            <p>After finalizing the high fidelity prototype and refining the final changes based on feedback received from the stakeholders, I moved on to preparing site maps. They serve as a smaller user journeys of functionalities that the desktop solution offers. This step helps developers understand where buttons link in the app as well as how are different screens are linked to each other. This was a newly introduced process for easy.bi company and developers greeted this it with a lot of positivity. It didn't only simplify their work process but it also provided them a visual understanding of how the app functions.
