            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <h3>One app that connects travelers and locals and fulfills the need of both target groups.</h3>
            <p>Problem</p>
            <p>
Tourists on a budget who visit Copenhagen want to have a local personal experience,
while getting good quality pictures of their travel, without having to take selfies or
ask random people to take their photo.
Amateur photographers struggle to get recognition for their work because of lack
of experience and material for their portfolio.</p>
           <p>Solution</p>
            <p>
To the tourist, we offer an app where they can look up a photographer and book
a personalized city tour at an affordable price.
Photographers are given a chance to build the international network, gain recognition
and build their photo portfolio while earning some extra money on the side.

            <h1>Personas</h1>
            <h3> Personas were inspired by visitors of Copenhagen. We interviewed tourists in Nyhavn and with gathered insights created personas.</h3>
            <p>First persona focuses on travelers, visitors to Copenhagen that are either
traveling solo or in a small group. Millenials and young families that travel
on the budget and want to get the most out of their Copenhagen experience.
By booking Viewfinder tour they can experience the city through the local’s eye
and gain high-quality photos. In general they like photography and culture.

            </p><p>
Second persona we focused on is a photographer tour guide. Creation of photographer persona was inspired by talking to local photographers and tourist guides.

            <h3> How will the user find Viewfinder and steps on how does the service happen?</h3>
            <p>The survey and interview results revealed we should appear on social media platforms and on trusted platforms such as TripAdvisor, Lonely Planet and visticopenhagen.com.
            </p>
            <p>Upon booking the service users meet with the photographer and they start the tour around the city. A photographer takes photos of the customers and provides relevant information about the attractions, the city, and the life in Copenhagen. Per custumer’s request photographer can provide up to 3 photos on the spot so the customer can share them instantly with friends and family. Customers are encouraged to tag our company when they share photos taken by ViewFinder’s photographers.
            </p>
            <p>By next day photographer sends all photos and offer extra features such as fixing up photos in Photoshop.
To maintain a good customer relationship we send a printed photo of the customer to her personal address with a thank you note.</p>

            <h3>We want to appear professional, trustworthy but fun and passionate at the same time.</h3>
            <p>I was in charge of designing the complete phone interface. The goal was to create
a clean and clear interface that connects with both personas and consists of all the
features implemented in the app. Performing user tests lead me to develope a clear
interaction points through the app that guide the user through the booking in a fun
and entertaining way. User finds the experience enjoyable and browsing through
photographer’s portfolios inspireing. They can use the advnced feature of an interactive
map to design their own personalized tour and read more about specific attractions.
</p>
            <p>On the other hand, photographers interface consists of different features, such as their
profile page, portfolio suggestions and simple and clear messaging platform where
they can communicate with other photographers as well as the clients.
