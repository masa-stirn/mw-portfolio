            <h1>Problem / Solution</h1>
            <h3>Gabriele Nicola is a young sculptor from Italy. He contacted us to help him build his brand identity, website and a promotional video of his moving art. </h3>
            <p>Problem</p>
            <p>The challenge was that Gabriele is still young and hasn't developed his personal brand identity yet and is still exploring different art styles rather focusing on specific category. In building the website we have to create the product that takes into account Gabriele's wishes and values as well as communicates the right message and sells to the target audience of art buyers. Since this was also our 2nd semester school project we have to deliver the results professors were expecting.
</p>
           <p>Solution</p>
            <p>
            We decided to focus on building strong emotional selling point (ESP) which was important to the artist and could reflect artists personality to his buyers and followers.
We decided to build a website that would help him establish more credibility in front of his buyers and galleries. The website should also help him share his art with a broader audience, sell his work and inform his followers of the upcoming exhibitions and events. Since his works involves movement, we decided to incorporate video.

            <h1>Project Management</h1>
            <h3>Trello software as Kanban chart</h3>
            <p>
We used Trello and inputed tasks in the to-do list system. We color coded the tasks based on the nature of the task. For example design tasks were purple and business tasks were blue. This gave everyone quick overview on where the tasks focus is.
            </p>
            <p>
            We held a meeting every day and discussed task progress as well as assigned new tasks if needed. As a Scrum master I was in charge of leading the meetings and motivating the team members to complete the tasks within the deadline. If situation called for it I assigned a second to help on more demanding tasks.

            <h1>Business Model Canvas</h1>
            <h3>Visual overview of Viewfinder startup idea</h3>
            <p>
Business model canvas helped us determine mission, vision and values of young artist. We discussed and defined 3 different types of customers which later helped us develop more refined personas. Based on the information we aquired by performing market research and conducting interview with the artists and some of his customers we were able to asses cost and suggest revenue streams. </p>
           <p>
           It was very crucial to determine key activities and their order. We didn't only want to successfully complete the school project but to also deliver a profitable and useful product to the client. We soon realized our mission doesn't lay just in designing a product but also to guide and educate the artist how can most benefit from the developed solution.

            <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
            <h3>Typography, color choices and personalized iconography</h3>
            <p>Together with Poulina we worked on defining smart design choices based on Viewfinder's mission, vision and values as well as what best communicates to the target users.</p>
            <p>On the right you can see the process and stages of the design: colors, typeface, icons, print elements. We started with very feminine colors and later decide to change design to dark purple and cyan which would communicate not only to the feminine target group but also to the professional target group of photographers. Photographers are a key element in our business model, therefore, the change of color theme was essential in order for both target groups to relate with the design.

            </p>
            <p>Upon booking the service users meet with the photographer and they start the tour around the city. A photographer takes photos of the customers and provides relevant information about the attractions, the city, and the life in Copenhagen. Per customer’s request photographer can provide up to 3 photos on the spot so the customer can share them instantly with friends and family. Customers are encouraged to tag our company when they share photos taken by ViewFinder’s photographers.
            </p>
            <p>By next day photographer sends all photos and offer extra features such as fixing up photos in Photoshop.
To maintain a good customer relationship we send a printed photo of the customer to her personal address with a thank you note.</p>
