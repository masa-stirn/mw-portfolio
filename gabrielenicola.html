            <h1>Problem / Solution</h1>
            <h3>Gabriele Nicola is a young sculptor from Italy. He contacted us to help him build his brand identity, website and a promotional video of his moving art. </h3>
            <p>Problem</p>
            <p>The challenge was that Gabriele is still young and hasn't developed his personal brand identity yet and is still exploring different art styles rather focusing on specific category. In building the website we have to create the product that takes into account Gabriele's wishes and values as well as communicates the right message and sells to the target audience of art buyers. Since this was also our 2nd semester school project we have to deliver the results professors were expecting.
</p>
           <p>Solution</p>
            <p>
            We decided to focus on building strong emotional selling point (ESP) which was important to the artist and could reflect artists personality to his buyers and followers.
We decided to build a website that would help him establish more credibility in front of his buyers and galleries. The website should also help him share his art with a broader audience, sell his work and inform his followers of the upcoming exhibitions and events. Since his works involves movement, we decided to incorporate video.

            <h1>Project Management</h1>
            <h3>Trello software as Kanban chart</h3>
            <p>
We used Trello and inputed tasks in the to-do list system. We color coded the tasks based on the nature of the task. For example design tasks were purple and business tasks were blue. This gave everyone quick overview on where the tasks focus is.
            </p>
            <p>
            We held a meeting every day and discussed task progress as well as assigned new tasks if needed. As a Scrum master I was in charge of leading the meetings and motivating the team members to complete the tasks within the deadline. If situation called for it I assigned a second to help on more demanding tasks.

            <h1>Business Model Canvas</h1>
            <h3>Visual overview of Viewfinder startup idea</h3>
            <p>
Business model canvas helped us determine mission, vision and values of young artist. We discussed and defined 3 different types of customers which later helped us develop more refined personas. Based on the information we aquired by performing market research and conducting interview with the artists and some of his customers we were able to asses cost and suggest revenue streams. </p>
           <p>
           It was very crucial to determine key activities and their order. We didn't only want to successfully complete the school project but to also deliver a profitable and useful product to the client. We soon realized our mission doesn't lay just in designing a product but also to guide and educate the artist how can most benefit from the developed solution.

            <p>Two of us took on the task to organize where and how the content should be presented on the artist's website.</p>
            <p>We came up with two very different solutions for the content layout. We proceeded by adding actual content and creating high fidelity prototypes. Then we user tested both designs on potential users. With the feedback on hand we were able to revisit both designs and merged the solutions into one user centered solution.

            <p>Moodbord was put together by the team to ensure everyone is on the same page of what is a conceptual art. It provides the basic grounds for the project and gave us a guidance of the style we should pursue.
</p>
            <p>We decided to prepare 2 style tiles that include typography and color choices for the website. The choices were based on the market research such as competitor analysis as well as on the materials that we received from the artists himself. The colors and textures were picked from his artwork and were focused on the warm natural ambiance.

            <p></p>
            <p>Through our iterative process we conducted various user tests and interviews. First we interviewed the artist himself as well as some of his art colleges. Then we moved and interviewed the art galleries to learn more about what they are looking for in young artists. Lastly once we prepared design content we tested the prototypes. First we conducted the BERT test. Results showed both designs were accepted positively by the potential users. However the 5 seconds test results showed that users saw design 1 as furniture website and design 2 more closely resembled an artist website. Lastly, we conducted multiple card sorting tests to help us define the information architecture of the content on each page.
