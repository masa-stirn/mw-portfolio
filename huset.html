            <h3> Personas were inspired by real users of Huset. Our focus was mainly international audience.</h3>
            <p>Event seeker is the persona that attends Huset’s events. Huset offers a broad variety of event. From vibrant underground and alternative music scene to film screenings and theatre show accompanied with a glass of wine.</p>
            <p>Volunteers work for Huset, they are the structure of the organization. They take care of bars, tickets, organizing events and contacting performers and actors to set up future collaborations.

            </p>
            <p>The performer could be a single artist or a complete band, or could even be a theatre crew. Uper coming or established artists that would like to book and perform at one of Huset’s venues.

            <h1>Card Sorting Test</h1>
            <h3> We performed card sorting test on 5 different users. We did so in two rounds of tets</h3>
            <p>The first card sorting test showed that the users were confused by our choice for the 3 main navigation categories: Events, Performers, Volunteers. While they understood the persona behind Performers and Volunteers they weren’t able to connect the persona behind the Events. Both performers and volunteers referred to a person while events referred to a subject.
Solution: we renamed Events into Eventseekers.
            </p>
            <p>The second test reviled that users had the need to collocate the 3-sub menu navigation: Cinema, Theatre, Concerts. Both in EVENTSEEKER and PERFORMERS part of the app. As a solution, we decided to implement a filter option on the Event page  of the EVENTSEEKER Web App.

            <h1>Design Process</h1>
            <h3>We prepared a design booklet consisting of business goals, user test reports, and visual design guidelines.</h3>
            <p>In the design brief we defined business goals such us mission, vision and values for the new Huset app. We user tested the existing Huset website and decided to the elements we can reuse. For user testing we conducted think aloud test. We asked users to verbalized their thoughts while they moved through the interface of the app.</p>
            <p>In design program we describe and justify decision about chosen logo, colors and typography.</p>
            <p>Design process gives insights into our design steps and work flow. We started with lo-fidelity prototypes such as sketches and wireframes. We prepared a style tile with specific design guidelines. Then we conducted card sorting tests to help us define best navigation choices and set up IA. Finally we designed hi-fidelity clickable XD prototypes and design mock-ups.</p>
            <p>Design manual serves as a page where designers and developers can look up defined color codes, typography specifications as well as icons and buttons descriptions.</p>

            <h1>User Interface</h1>
            <h3>Let’s build a fluid and flexible user interface that is
unique and yet inherently intuitive.</h3>
            <p>With the team, I worked together on designing the product from the ground up. Having
free reign over the web app’s look and feel, I really enjoyed working on branding. We
agreed on creating a new corporate identity for Huset.
</p>
            <p>The only graphical element we
kept from Huset’s existing brand was the logo. We used its negative on the vibrant
gradient backgrounds. Working with colors, fonts, and icons as well
as implementing the fifth element that takes the users’ experience to the next level was fun and rewarding.
            </p>
            <p>Huset is all about the events and performance and users attending them. We
focused on designing a modern, clear and high contrast design allowing the users to
easily navigate through all three platforms of the app.
