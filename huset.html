            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <h3> Designing user interfaces by focusing on delivering quality user experience. </h3>
            <p>Huset web app is the brand-new way for Huset’s target audience to interact with Huset on their phone. In the intro screen, the user chooses their interest and enters one of the three platforms and starts the journeys of experiencing the app.</p>
            <p>Aside from leading the design process, I was responsible to develop performer platform of the app. The main challenge for the whole team was to keep the design consistent throughout all three platforms but yet different so the users know when they switch between the platforms.
            </p>
            <p>We performed multiple user tests, starting with card sorting to determine navigation structure. When we had the designs ready we performed BERT test to gain subjective design feedback. And lastly, on high fidelity prototypes, we conducted multiple think aloud tests that helped us improve usability.

            <h3> Personas were inspired by real users of Huset. Our focus was mainly international audience.</h3>
            <p>Event seeker is the persona that attends Huset’s events. Huset offers a broad variety of event. From vibrant underground and alternative music scene to film screenings and theatre show accompanied with a glass of wine.</p>
            <p>Volunteers work for Huset, they are the structure of the organization. They take care of bars, tickets, organizing events and contacting performers and actors to set up future collaborations.

            </p>
            <p>The performer could be a single artist or a complete band, or could even be a theatre crew. Uper coming or established artists that would like to book and perform at one of Huset’s venues.

            <h1>Wireframes</h1>
            <h3> The layout of the phone UI that demonstrates the key elements used in performer platform of the app.</h3>
            <p>Before starting the process we first determine the goals, scope and future vison for the app. </p>
            <p>We spent a lot of time discussing the design and layout options followed with sketching different layout possibilities.
            </p>
            <p>Process was continued by performing of testing and user flows with card sorting tests that helped us define key layouts and interaction patterns. After final iterations of low fidelity prototypes, I moved onto making high fidelity wireframes.

            <h1>User Interface</h1>
            <h3>Let’s build a fluid and flexible user interface that is
unique and yet inherently intuitive.</h3>
            <p>With the team, I worked together on designing the product from the ground up. Having
free reign over the web app’s look and feel, I really enjoyed working on branding. We
agreed on creating a new corporate identity for Huset.
</p>
            <p>The only graphical element we
kept from Huset’s existing brand was the logo. We used its negative on the vibrant
gradient backgrounds. Working with colors, fonts, and icons as well
as implementing the fifth element that takes the users’ experience to the next level was fun and rewarding.
            </p>
            <p>Huset is all about the events and performance and users attending them. We
focused on designing a modern, clear and high contrast design allowing the users to
easily navigate through all three platforms of the app.
