            <h1>Problem / Solution</h1>
            <h3>One app that connects security office management with security guards.</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Problem</p>
            <p>
Security guards receive a printed excel spreadsheet of their weekly and daily work schedules. This approach lives little room for flexibility and changes that might occur based on changing client needs. Moreover, sometimes clients report that the security guard didn't perform the complete patrol.
</p>
           <p>Solution</p>
            <p>
A system of mobile and desktop app that makes the scheduling process dynamic and flexible. For the security office managers we designed a desktop supervising tool where they can plan and manage security guards' schedules. In the mobile app managers have an option to create patrols and assign them to security guards. Security guards get to use patrol app that lists their patrols and even allows them to incorporate their personal task into their daily schedule. Application provides instructions to scan QR codes placed at each of the designated locations and add notes and photo material when necessary. The progress of each task is automatically documented which gives stakeholders an opportunity to track employees progress.

            <h1>Brainstorming</h1>
            <h3>First 2 days of work were focused on group brainstorm sessions</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
Brainstorming on the whiteboard, with the company owner Andrej and my manager Filip, was the key step in the process of generating ideas and discussing the market needs. In order to get a better idea of what the app should deliver we sketched various product ideas and we wrote down features we believed the app should deliver. Also we browsed through similar apps and designs and performed competitor analyses. Once we had the general idea laid out, I moved on to learning more about the target users.

            <h3> Personas were created using insights from talking to the target group and analyzing their daily schedules.</h3>
            </div>
            <p>The main persona that will use the patrol station mobile app is the security guard. He works for a large security office that manages over 1000 employees. He is assigned daily tasks and patrols every morning. He uses his car to drive from one location to another and completes the patrols. Using the patrol station app will help him plan his day. He can manage all of his work tasks and patrol tours in one easy to use mobile app. The schedule gives him an overview of daily assignments.
            </p><p>
The second persona that will use mobile app is the manager, patrol planner, persona. This persona works at the security office and uses both desktop and mobile app. She uses the mobile app to plan the patrol tours. She places QR codes at patrol locations and adds patrol tours into the digital system. This persona is the manager of the security guards and has so far been providing security guards with the excel spreadsheets of daily schedules.

            <p>As the only designer in the company I tackled the next step on my own. I spent an afternoon to bring ideas we generated at the brainstorm sessions to life. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I presented the sketches next day to my manager Filip and founder Andrej. Since sketches were drawn with pencil it was very easy to redesign and add additional changes. We also called in developers to keep them in loop of what we were planning to develop and got their feedback and opinion regarding time span for development of the features.

            <p>To ensure consistent use of colors and typography throughout all of the app platforms, I defined some general design guidelines in a style tile document. It was later shared with developers which helped them follow styles as close as possible to the design outlines.
            </p>
            <p>To help developers with faster integration of icons I created SVG icons and generated icon font through the Icomoon online platform. The font consisted of all the icons that can easily be add to the app with one line of code and then called and styled later in the code as needed.

            <p>High fidelity prototype screenshots on the right are showing visual insights of finalized designs. High fidelity prototypes were refined and redesigned based on the feedback received from everyone involved in the project, from other team members and employees from various departments to the users. </p>
            <p>Example of one feature that was integrated based on user feedback is light and dark app theme. Different dark and light themes were designed based on the interviews conducted with security guards. We took into consideration that security guards work day and night shifts; therefore, at night dark theme is more pleasant for their eye. Swapping between themes should be easy and very straight forward.

            <h3>Site maps help developers understand the process of moving through the app. </h3>

            <p>I prepared the site maps taking the stakeholders and target audience comments in consideration. They showcase smaller user journeys of functionalities that the app should offer.
</p>
            <p>This step was crucial to help developers understand what the purpose is behind the buttons within the app and how different screens are linked to each other. This was a newly introduced process for easy.bi company and developers greeted this new addition with a lot of positivity. It didn't only simplify their work process, but it also provided them an overview of all the functionalities and a visual understanding of how they are correlated within the app.
